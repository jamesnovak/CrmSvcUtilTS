## 12/09/2017 - Latest checkin includes:
* Adding ability to save and load configuration settings, such as entity and attribute filters. 
* Added filter on Virtual Attributes to reduce noise in the generated template.
* Added Language Code value to ensure that labels are consistent if more than one Localized Label is present.
* Will now prompt to update the template saved to the plugin settings folder if a new version is released instead of just overwriting values.
* Various cosmetic bug fixes around loading, filtering, and sorting of the Entity List.
* Miscellaneous updates to the default template for Angular scripts.

Documentation will be updated shortly
